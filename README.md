# bhd - backwards hexdump

## What?

Hexdumps a file, with the bytes ordered from right to left instead of left to right.

## Seriously, what?

The use case is when the file is a binary file full of little-endian fields.
By reversing the byte order so it matches the order of digits within each byte,
it becomes easier to read the field values by eye.

The `--group` option allows bytes to be grouped together in a consistent way,
to make reading highly structured files easier.
